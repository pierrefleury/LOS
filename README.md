# LOS
Research project on line-of-sight effects in strong gravitational lensing

This folder contains the jupyter notebooks and files that were used to generate the plots of [arXiv:2104.XXXXX].

Contents
- The notebook “figures_los.ipynb” generates lensing images.
- The notebook “generate_spectra_crit_curves.ipynb” generates the power spectra of critical modes from CAMB and plot them.
- The folder “data_spectra” contains the spectra generated from “generate_spectra.ipynb”
- The notebook “plot_spectra_crit_curves.ipynb” plots the specta in the folder “data_spectra”.
